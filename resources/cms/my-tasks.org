** DONE check 3s & 7s mods under 21 not repeat & cover 0 - 6
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-04-11 Wed 09:04]
NOT repeat:
make 0 - 21 as ONE sequence, 
take 0 as reference, the related distance is 0, 3, 6, 9, ... 21
take 7 as reference, the related distance is 2, 5, 8, 11, ... 23
take 14 as reference, the related distance is 1, 4, 7, 10, ... 22

Cover 0 - 6:
3 * 7 = 21, so there are 3 references & 7 mods
1st approve, 7 mods not repeat so cover 0 - 6
2sd approve, 

How 21 comes?
NOT 21, but 21 referenced point
Because of difference of 3 & 7
More pairs of 7 & 3, 7s array will bigger than 3s array until the bigger is an i * 3



they not repeat
