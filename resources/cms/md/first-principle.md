# All learning's goal

to shape the target via observation.


# Common shapes in IT
  
* PCA(Primitive, Combination, Abstraction)

  * Recursion  
    e.g. 
        function
          defined with itself
        data  
          s-expression

  * Group

    * Vertical Group  
      e.g. have different layers
    * Horizontal Group  
      e.g. put same in one group, different in the other group

  * Convertional Interface



Note:  
PCA is also the shape of knowlege  
Nubmer system also can follow PCA  
e.g.  
    Primitive: 1
    Combination: + 
    Get Abstraction: 2
    Now get component: 1, 2
    do the same on above to get: 1, 2, 3, 4
    do the same on above to get: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
