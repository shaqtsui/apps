# 为什么SICP
很少学校使用SICP做教材，但计算机四大名校中三所使用SICP (MIT, Stanford University, UC Berkeley)


Peter Norvig(谷歌研究总监, NASA Ames计算科学部门负责人, UC Berkeley研究员)
> it works only if the **reader is at heart a computer scientist**  
To use an analogy, if SICP were about automobiles, it would be for the person who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient, safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate SICP are the ones who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.

> I bought my first copy 15 years ago, and I still don't feel I have learned everything the book has to teach.  
Yet SICP, which is pretty much the **bible of our world**

Brian Harvey
> Before SICP, the first CS course was almost always entirely filled with learning the details of some programming language. SICP is about standing back from the details to learn big-picture ways to think about the programming process.  
computer science should be about ideas, not entirely about programming practice  
**the best computer science book in the world**  
The invention of the MapReduce software for data parallelism at Google, based on functional programming ideas, has helped eliminate that ivory-tower reputation.

> Number 127: Big important book  
Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, a pair of MIT computer science professors, wrote “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,” which remains a classic for encouraging the teaching of not one specific programming language, but big-picture themes students could apply across a range of programming scenarios.
