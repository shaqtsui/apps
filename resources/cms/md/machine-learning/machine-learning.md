Square Error Cost Function

J(theta0, theta1)



line regression
  all points on the function line as many as possible

classify
  positive group points above the function line as many as possible
  negtive group points under the function line as many as possible
  
  x -> y -> round(y)
  no function line to map x to y, which is to map different values to only 2 value, the shape is some horizontal lines




Regression Model:
theta[] -> hyposethis-func
x[], hyposethis-func -> estimated-y[]
estimated-y[], y[] -> error[]
estimated-y[], y[] -> error[], cost-func -> cost[]


theta[], mean(cost[]) ->
