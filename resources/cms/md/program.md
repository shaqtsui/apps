# Program

Program is [Solution Specification](solution-specification.md)(a set of instructions)

Program Impl(Behavior) should support language semantics.

## Steps to create it:

* Programmer write Program Source Code, which may contains [Problem Specification](problem-specification.md) or/and [Solution Specification](solution-specification.md) via [Programming Language](programming-language.md)
* If there is Problem Specification in source, [Solution Generator](solution-generator.md) will generate Solution Specification from Problem Specification
* If Executor recognized format is different from Program Source, [Compiler](compiler.md) convert it to recognized format

## Program State

* Source
* Artifact
* Runtime
