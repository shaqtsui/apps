# Agile

## Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools
* Working software over Comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation
* Responding to change over Following a plan
      
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
		
		
## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.		
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.		
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.		
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.		
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.		
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.		
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.		
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.		
* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.		
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.		
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
		

		
## Concrete Implementations:

* SCRUM
* KANBAN


    lean and just-in-time (JIT) production  
    Cycle time is a key metric for kanban team  
    Cycle time is the amount of time it takes for a unit of work to travel through the teamâ€™s workflow  
    A control chart shows the cycle time for each issue as well as a rolling average for the team.
