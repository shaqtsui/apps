Idea > Implementation


e.g.
Idea:
code in list stucture
multiple layer process(reader, macro compiler, executor)
uniform sequence view of different data

Corresponding Impl:
lisp, scheme, clojure, chicken ...
Racket, common lisp, clojure ...
clojure(current IO don't support sequenc view, I hope it can support) ...
