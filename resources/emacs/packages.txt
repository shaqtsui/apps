built-in
IDO - choice narrow
electric-pair-mode - auto insert pares



other
heml - similar to IDO
company - code complete, default supported by cider via backend: capf(standard complete at point function)
auto-complete - same as company



most dowloads to be checked:
yasnippet - template system, good for verbose language like html, lisp-family is consise
projectile - easy find file in project, good for complex project, but lisp-family is consie
smartparents - like paredit, but support more languages, this means this is complex as language agnostic
expand-region - seems can be replace by paredit mode via navi & node select
paredit-mode - op on pares, not maintained in github, only support lisp-family lauguagae, seems this is more geek compared to smartparents. As I don't want to touch other complex language, lisp-family is my focus, so I prefer this pkg.
autopair - very similar to electric-pair-mode, author prefer electric-pair-mode
