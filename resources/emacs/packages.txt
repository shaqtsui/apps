built-in
IDO - choice narrow
electric-pair-mode - auto insert pares
flymake - on-the-fly syntax check, outdated, last update on 2009, use flycheck replace
GUD - Grand Unified Debugger, interface to many symbolic debuggers, e.g. GDB(GUN Debugger), DBX, SDB, PDB(python), JDB(java). Issue: it iterface with these debugger tools via process IO, which is a misuse of these tools, as process IO supposed to interface with human beings.
    jdb
	All these variables are used to search source path, nothing to do with classpath for runtime:
	gud-jdb-use-classpath specify source lookup in classpath or gud-jdb-directories
	(prefer use-classpath, as start is quick & easy to control)
	gud-jdb-classpath normally auto setted to the value returned by jdb instance
	gud-jdb-sourcepath auto setted to the value provided to jdb via -sourcepath, this value will preappend to gud-jdb-classpath to be the source search dir.

	JDK source not in classpath, so startup command should be:
	jdb -attach 8000 -sourcepathd:/Shark/Apps/Java/jdk1.8.0_144/src.zip
	for other java source can be added via project.clj

auto-revert-mode/auto-revert-tail-mode - alot detact changes & reload
winner-mode - enable undo window config(layout, size...)




other
lispy - reimange of paredit, short key to invoke function before ( & after ) instead of insert
which-key - pop available commands when prefix key pressed. Same logic as hydra, but successive key will mostly triger reminder function no other function
ivy - set var completing-read-function from completing-read-default to ivy-completing-read, var completion-in-region-function from completion--in-region to ivy-completion-in-region
counsel - replace other common emacs commands to use ivy based functions
swiper - alternative to isearch
avy - jump via char-based decision tree

ein - api for interacting with jupyter notebook frontend, notebook viewer
emacs-jupyter - api for interacting with jupyter kernels, 2 frontends: built-in repl & org-mode source block

helm - similar to IDO
company - code complete, default supported by cider via backend: capf(standard complete at point function)
auto-complete - same as company
flycheck - on the fly syntax check
flycheck-clojure(squiggly-clojure) - clojure support for flycheck
racket-mode - like cider, for racket
geiser - like cider, for racket chichen ...
rainbow-delimiters - show different color for parens in different depth
paren-face - show parentheses with differnt style, functions covered by rainbow-delimiters
hydra - simulate mode(invoke a parent func to capture input to invoke child function). Logic: A leader key state is stored, so all succesive keys behavior depends on leader key, a special key(some ending key) will remove leader from store. Possible Impl: (s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 ...); key press -> append key sequence -> trigger function(may update/delete key sequence)

# java plugins
malabar-mode - moved to jdee
emacs-eclim - reply on eclipse backend
jdee - java env, now actively maintained from 2015, but as of 2017/08 its still very young, will support build tools in future
ensime - lsp like,mainly support scala, java support via enjime, support sbt, lein, maven, gradle
meghanada-emacs - lsp like, same architecture as ensime, no debug support as of 2017/08
cdt - debug clojure code to invoke JDI, which connect to remove VM, no update since 2012
ritz - similar to cdt, but more functionality,  no update since 2012
lsp - microsoft's protocal for general editor & languages



most dowloads to be checked:
yasnippet - template system, good for verbose language like html, lisp-family is consise
projectile - easy find file in project, good for complex project, but lisp-family is consie
smartparents - like paredit, but support more languages, this means this is complex as language agnostic
expand-region - seems can be replace by paredit mode via navi & node select
paredit-mode - op on pares, not maintained in github, only support lisp-family lauguagae, seems this is more geek compared to smartparents. As I don't want to touch other complex language, lisp-family is my focus, so I prefer this pkg.
autopair - very similar to electric-pair-mode, author prefer electric-pair-mode
