built-in
IDO - choice narrow
electric-pair-mode - auto insert pares
flymake - on-the-fly syntax check, outdated, last update on 2009, use flycheck replace
GUD - Grand Unified Debugger, interface to many symbolic debuggers, e.g. GDB(GUN Debugger), DBX, SDB, PDB(python), JDB(java). Issue: it iterface with these debugger tools via process IO, which is a misuse of these tools, as process IO supposed to interface with human beings.
    jdb
	All these variables are used to search source path, nothing to do with classpath for runtime:
	gud-jdb-use-classpath specify source lookup in classpath or gud-jdb-directories
	(prefer use-classpath, as start is quick & easy to control)
	gud-jdb-classpath normally auto setted to the value returned by jdb instance
	gud-jdb-sourcepath auto setted to the value provided to jdb via -sourcepath, this value will preappend to gud-jdb-classpath to be the source search dir.

	JDK source not in classpath, so startup command should be:
	jdb -attach 8000 -sourcepathd:/Shark/Apps/Java/jdk1.8.0_144/src.zip
	for other java source can be added via project.clj

auto-revert-mode/auto-revert-tail-mode - alot detact changes & reload

# java plugins
malabar-mode - moved to jdee
emacs-eclim - reply on eclipse backend
jdee - java env, now actively maintained from 2015, but as of 2017/08 its still very young, will support build tools in future
ensime - lsp like,mainly support scala, java support via enjime, support sbt, lein, maven, gradle
meghanada-emacs - lsp like, same architecture as ensime, no debug support as of 2017/08
cdt - debug clojure code to invoke JDI, which connect to remove VM, no update since 2012
ritz - similar to cdt, but more functionality,  no update since 2012
lsp - microsoft's protocal for general editor & languages



most dowloads to be checked:
yasnippet - template system, good for verbose language like html, lisp-family is consise
projectile - easy find file in project, good for complex project, but lisp-family is consie
smartparents - like paredit, but support more languages, this means this is complex as language agnostic
expand-region - seems can be replace by paredit mode via navi & node select
paredit-mode - op on pares, not maintained in github, only support lisp-family lauguagae, seems this is more geek compared to smartparents. As I don't want to touch other complex language, lisp-family is my focus, so I prefer this pkg.
autopair - very similar to electric-pair-mode, author prefer electric-pair-mode
